## Introduction

The Rocket Pool JavaScript library is the primary means of interaction with the Rocket Pool network for users and applications. It is used by applications such as the [Rocket Pool website](https://www.rocketpool.net/) to retrieve information about the network and facilitate user interaction. It provides wrapper methods which load the Rocket Pool contracts with [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) and abstractions to use many of their features easily.

This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript and provides all code samples as JS.
