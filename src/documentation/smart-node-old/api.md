# API Reference


## The Smart Node API

The Rocket Pool smart node service includes an API accessible via the `api` container.
API commands can be invoked via `docker exec` on the machine running the service::

```
docker exec rocketpool_api /go/bin/rocketpool api [command] [subcommand] [args...]
```

The API is consumed by the smart node client, which offers a CLI interface for all provided functionality.
API endpoints are provided for extension by applications wishing to interact with a running smart node.

All arguments for ETH or token amounts are given in wei.
All endpoints return data in JSON format, always including `status` and `error` properties.
