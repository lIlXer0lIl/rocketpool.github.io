# :card_index_dividers: Javascript Library

## Introduction

The Rocket Pool JavaScript library is the primary means of interaction with the Rocket Pool network for users and applications. It is used by applications such as the Rocket Pool website to retrieve information about the network and facilitate user interaction. It provides wrapper methods which load the Rocket Pool contracts with web3.js and abstractions to use many of their features easily.

This guide assumes familiarity with JavaScript and provides all code samples as JS.


## Getting Started

### Installation
The Rocket Pool JavaScript library can be added to your application via NPM, and requires [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/):

``` shell
npm install github:rocket-pool/rocketpool-js
npm install web3
```

### Initialization

The library must be initialized with a web3 instance and a [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) `RocketStorage` contract artifact:
``` javascript
import Web3 from 'web3';
import RocketPool from 'rocketpool';
import RocketStorage from './contracts/RocketStorage.json';

const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

const rp = new RocketPool(web3, RocketStorage);
```

### Usage
The Rocket Pool library is divided into several modules, each for interacting with a different aspect of the network:

* `contracts`: Handles dynamic loading of the Rocket Pool contracts
* `deposit`: Handles user deposits
* `minipool`: Manages minipools in the Rocket Pool network
* `network`: Handles miscellaneous network functionality
* `node`: Manages the nodes making up the Rocket Pool network
* `settings.deposit`: Provides information on user deposit settings
* `settings.minipool`: Provides information on minipool settings
* `settings.network`: Provides information on network settings
* `settings.node`: Provides information on smart node settings
* `tokens.neth`: Manages nETH token interactions
* `tokens.reth`: Manages rETH token interactions

All methods typically return promises due to the asynchronous nature of working with the Ethereum network. Getters return promises which resolve to their value, while mutators (methods which send transactions) return promises which resolve to a transaction receipt. Mutators also accept a transaction options object, and an `onConfirmation` callback handler to handle specific confirmation numbers on transactions.

When using the Rocket Pool library in your project, you may handle the promises returned in the traditional way, or use async/await syntax if supported, e.g.:
``` solidity
rp.contracts.get('rocketDepositPool')
    .then(rocketDepositPool => rocketDepositPool.methods.getBalance().call())
    .then(balance => { console.log(balance); });
```
or:
``` solidity
let rocketDepositPool = await rp.contracts.get('rocketDepositPool');
let balance = await rocketDepositPool.methods.getBalance().call();
console.log(balance);
```

## Contracts
### Overview
The `contracts` module loads Rocket Pool contract ABIs and addresses from `RocketStorage`, where all network contracts are registered. Contract ABIs and addresses are loaded from the chain, the ABIs are decompressed and decoded, and then web3 contract instances are created from them. This is performed dynamically because Rocket Pool contracts can be upgraded and their ABIs and addresses may change.

This module is used by other library modules internally, and generally does not need to be used directly. However, it is exposed publicly for when direct access to web3 contract instances is desired, or the library wrapper methods are insufficient.

### Loading Contracts & ABIs
Network contracts can be loaded via the `contracts.get()` method, which accepts either a single contract name as a string, or a list of contract names as an array of strings. If a single contract name is passed, this method returns a promise resolving to a web3 contract instance. If a list of contract names is passed, it returns a promise resolving to an array of web3 contract instances, in the same order.

Contract addresses and ABIs can be loaded in a similar fashion via the `contracts.address()` and `contracts.abi()` methods, which accept either a single contract name, or a list of names, to retrieve data for.

### Creating Contract Instances
Some network contracts, such as `RocketMinipool`, have multiple instances deployed at a number of different addresses. To create an instance of one of these contracts, use the `contracts.make(name, address)` method. It accepts the name of the contract and the address of the specific instance required, both as strings, and returns a promise resolving to a web3 contract instance.

### Alternate Contract Versions
When Rocket Pool network contracts are upgraded, old versions remain on the chain and can still be accessed if required. A “contract version set”, consisting of all versions of a contract by name, can be loaded with the `contracts.versions(name)` method. This method accepts the name of the contract to load, and returns a promise resolving to the version set object.

Contract version sets are primarily used for accessing old event data. They provide the following methods:

* `versionSet.current()`: Returns the current version of the contract
* `versionSet.first()`: Returns the first version of the contract deployed
* `versionSet.at(index)`: Returns the version of the contract at the specified version index (0 = first version)
* `versionSet.getPastEvents(eventName, options)`: As per [web3’s contract.getPastEvents](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/web3-eth-contract.html#getpastevents), but returns a promise resolving to the events for all versions of the contract


## Deposit

### Overview
The `deposit` module is used to get the current deposit pool balance, make user deposits, and assign deposited ETH to minipools.

### Methods
* `deposit.getBalance()`: Get the current balance of the deposit pool in wei; returns `Promise<string>`
* `deposit.deposit(options, onConfirmation)`: Make a user deposit; returns `Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
* `deposit.assignDeposits(options, onConfirmation)`: Assign deposited ETH to queued minipools; returns `Promise<TransactionReceipt>`

## Minipool

### Overview
The `minipool` module loads general minipool data from the chain. It also provides minipool contract functionality (which manages individual minipools and loads their data).

### Data Types
`MinipoolDetails` objects contain various globally registered details of a minipool:
```
MinipoolDetails {
    address                 // The registered address of the minipool
    exists                  // Whether the minipool exists
    pubkey                  // The minipool's associated validator pubkey
    withdrawalTotalBalance  // The minipool's total validator balance at withdrawal
    withdrawalNodeBalance   // The node's share of the validator balance at withdrawal
    withdrawable            // Whether the minipool has become withdrawable yet
    withdrawalProcessed     // Whether the minipool's withdrawal has been processed yet
}
```
`StatusDetails` objects define the current status of a minipool:
```
StatusDetails {
    status                  // The minipool's current status code
    block                   // The block at which the status was last changed
    time                    // The timestamp at which the status was last changed
}
```
`NodeDetails` objects contain details about the node owning a minipool:
```
NodeDetails {
    address                 // The address of the node owning the minipool
    fee                     // The node commission rate as a fraction of 1
    depositBalance          // The balance of ETH deposited by the node
    refundBalance           // The balance of ETH available for refund to the node
    depositAssigned         // Whether the node's ETH deposit has been assigned
}
```
`UserDetails` objects contain details about user ETH assigned to a minipool:
```
UserDetails {
    depositBalance          // The balance of ETH from Rocket Pool user deposits
    depositAssigned         // Whether user-deposited ETH has been assigned
    depositAssignedTime     // The timestamp at which user-deposited ETH was assigned
}
```
`StakingDetails` objects contain details about a minipool’s balance during staking:
```
StakingDetails {
    startBalance            // The minipool's balance when shared staking began
    endBalance              // The minipool's balance when shared staking finished
}
```
`MinipoolContract` objects wrap a web3 contract instance and provide methods for managing a minipool and retrieving its information.
